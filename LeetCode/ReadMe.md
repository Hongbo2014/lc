# Ideas
 ## Solve array problems
1. Try use two index.
2. Need sort?
3. Can use priority queue?
4. Go from front end and then try from backward.
5. Use stack? Make single increase/decrease queue?

## Others
1. Do not save space to introduce more error. like statement after if should use {}.
2. If a problem has two dimention need to solve, first resolve one dimention then solve other dimention.
3. Use cache to improve performance when running recursively.
4. Use devide and conquer might simplify the problem.
